# **Progress Report 1: Requirement Analysis**

**Company Name:** RideFlex Technologies
**Project Name:** RideFlex â€“ A Hybrid Uber + Turo Car Rental & Rideshare Platform

---

## 1. **Business Case**

The global ridesharing market is projected to exceed **\$200B by 2030**. Many individuals are excluded from ridesharing due to lack of vehicle ownership, while millions of cars remain unused by their owners. RideFlex addresses this market inefficiency by connecting drivers who need vehicles with owners willing to rent them out securely.

**Why now?**

* Post-pandemic, rideshare demand is increasing again.
* Drivers want flexible access without long-term contracts.
* Owners want passive income from idle vehicles.

**Opportunity:** RideFlex combines **Uberâ€™s driver access model** with **Turoâ€™s peer-to-peer rentals**, creating a new revenue stream for both parties and a platform for investors.

---

## 2. **Problem Statement**

* **Drivers:** Lack of access to affordable vehicles for ridesharing services.
* **Owners:** Struggle to monetize unused vehicles safely and reliably.
* **Market:** No integrated platform exists to solve both sidesâ€™ problems with security, payments, and analytics.

**Proposed Solution:** RideFlex provides a **secure, user-friendly web application** for drivers to rent cars for ridesharing and for owners to profit from idle vehicles.
